										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A highly urbanized city in Metro Manila, thereâ€™s no question that Pasig City is filled with landmarks. But skyscrapers aside, there are some historical structures worth mentioning within the city itself.</p>



<p>Pasig was once a rural settlement, but slowly evolved into a residential and industrial sector. Over the past few years, it has seen itself develop into a commercial center, largely thanks to the establishment of the Ortigas Center Business District on the eastern side of the city.</p>
