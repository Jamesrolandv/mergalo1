<p>Mandaluyong City is notable for its high-end malls. Also, being at the center of Metro Manila makes it a hub for businesses and commercial centers. The city stands in a prime location connected to nearby cities and provinces through a series of connecting thoroughfares and public transportation.&nbsp; Living in Mandaluyong can be so easy, close to key establishments and landmarks without traveling far from home. In this article, I will guide you through the activities you can do in and around the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Explore the malls of Mandaluyong</strong></h3>



<p>Mandaluyong City is one of the busiest cities in Metro Manila. This is due to the presence of large commercial establishments and malls that are accessible wherever you may go. If you are looking for a place to shop, dine, or watch a movie, then these malls should be your go-to places:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. SM Megamall</h4>



<p>SM Megamall is one of the biggest malls in the country. Located in Ortigas Business District and along Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue (EDSA), a shopping center is a go-to place for shopaholics and food lovers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1366" height="454" src="https://jamesrolandv.github.io/mergalo1/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-182"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smsupermalls.com/mall-directory/sm-megamall/information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SM Supermalls</a></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Shangri-La Plaza Mall&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Shangri-La Plaza Mall is another prime shopping destination in Mandaluyong City. The mall is also located in Ortigas Center and is just a stone’s throw away from SM Megamall.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1373" height="1075" src="https://jamesrolandv.github.io/mergalo1/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-186"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/shangrilaplazaofficial/photos/a.284984124914453/4684943784918443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shangri-La Mall FB Page</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The shopping center showcases its modern architectural and interior design. There are also lots of restaurants in the mall such as Texas Roadhouse, Cibo, Brotzeit German Restaurant, and many more. A sky garden located on its 6th floor can provide fresh air surrounded by landscaped gardens with a magnificent view of the city skyline.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Explore the parks</strong></h3>



<p>The city is also renowned for its parks and its distance to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://housinginteractive.com.ph/residential-property-sale-mandaluyong" target="_blank">residential developments</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://housinginteractive.com.ph/commercial-property-sale-mandaluyong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offices</a>&nbsp;makes it a haven away from the hustle and bustle. Some of the green spaces you can explore in the city are the following:&nbsp;</p>
